## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
App: Instagram
- the sidebar is amazing
- I like the profile page
- Threats
App: Twitter
- The refresh feature on main page
- The comments section of each post

I wanted to build a simple fitness app that can track daily workouts completed, giving a set of new workouts based on the options. 
One of the feature is to have a tracking page that can provide feedback/suggestions based on your weekly reports. 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

I went through some challenges such as some syntax errors with Swift. I think it really made me confused due to the new langauge that I was learning while finishing the prework but overall, I think I did a great job with the task.
